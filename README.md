# 🧪 BioTech Virtual Labs

## 📌 Project Overview

**BioTech Virtual Labs** is an interactive web-based virtual laboratory designed to simulate basic **Biology** and **Chemistry** experiments. The goal of this project is to help students understand scientific concepts through simple visual interactions and animations instead of only theoretical learning.

This website provides separate experiment pages where users can explore scientific processes like photosynthesis, respiration, density measurement, and acid–base reactions.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

* To create a beginner-friendly virtual lab experience.
* To demonstrate science experiments using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SVG animations**.
* To provide a structured platform for biology and chemistry learning.
* To simulate experiment steps visually so users can understand concepts easily.

## 🧬 Subjects Included

### 🌿 Biology

Biology experiments focus on life processes and plant/organism functions.

#### 1. Photosynthesis Experiment

* Demonstrates how plants convert sunlight into energy.
* Shows interaction between light, water, and carbon dioxide.
* Visual elements change during the experiment to simulate energy flow.

#### 2. Respiration Experiment

* Explains how organisms release energy from food.
* Demonstrates gas exchange concepts.
* Interactive steps help visualize oxygen intake and carbon dioxide release.

---

### ⚗️ Chemistry

Chemistry experiments simulate basic chemical reactions and physical properties.

#### 3. Acid–Base Experiment

* Demonstrates reaction between acids and bases.
* Includes indicator behavior (color changes).
* Shows how pH affects solutions.

#### 4. Density Experiment

* Explains the concept of density using object interaction.
* Simulates floating and sinking behavior.
* Helps understand mass vs volume visually.

## 🚀 Website Behaviour

* The **index page** acts as the main navigation hub.
* Users select a subject or experiment from the homepage.
* Each experiment opens on a separate HTML page.
* JavaScript controls animations and interaction logic.
* CSS provides styling and layout for the interface.
* SVG elements are used for visual scientific animations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5** – Page structure
* **CSS3** – Styling and layout
* **JavaScript** – Experiment logic and interactions
* **SVG** – Scientific visual animations
